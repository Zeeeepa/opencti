### Overall Quality Rating

**Rating:** 5/5 - Excellent

**Scale:**
- 5/5 - Excellent: Exemplary, ready for production use

### Top 3 Improvements

1. **Add a Glossary**
   Include definitions for specialized terms (CSPRNG, FIPS) to aid non-technical stakeholders.

2. **Explicit Out-of-Scope**
   Define out-of-scope items more prominently to prevent scope creep (e.g., rotation helpers).

3. **Traceability Matrix**
   Consider adding a small matrix linking FRs directly to Success Criteria IDs for explicit linkage.

### Summary

**This PRD is:** A highly professional, technically sound document that balances strategic vision with executable requirements.

**To make it great:** Focus on value-add improvements like a Glossary, but it's already production-ready.
